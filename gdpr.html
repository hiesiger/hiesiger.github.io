        <ul type="disc">
            <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
            <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
            <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
            <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>

        <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
        <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>

        <h4>Server data</h4>
        <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
        <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>

        <h4>Google AdWords with Conversion Tracking</h4>
        <p>Our website uses Google AdWords and conversion tracking. This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>
        <p>We use conversion tracking to provide targeted promotion of our site. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
        <p>If you click on an ad placed by Google, the conversion tracking we use stores a cookie on your device. These so-called conversion cookies expire after 30 days and do not otherwise identify you personally.</p>
        <p>If the cookie is still valid and you visit a specific page of our website, both we and Google can evaluate that you clicked on one of our ads placed on Google and that you were then forwarded to our website.</p>
        <p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. In addition, we receive information about the number of users who clicked on our advertisement(s) as well as about the pages on our site that are subsequently visited. Neither we nor third parties who also use Google AdWords will be able to identify you from this conversion tracking.</p>
        <p>You can also prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use.

        <p>Google AdSense stores cookies and web beacons on your device via your browser. This enables Google to analyze how you use our website.

Google may also share this information with third parties. Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data.</p>

        <h4>Google Remarketing</h4>
        <p>We use the remarketing function on our website. This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>
        <p>We use this feature to deliver interest-based, personalized advertising on third-party websites that also participate in Google's advertising network.</p>
        <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
        <p>To allow this advertising service to function, Google stores a cookie with a sequence of numbers on your device via your browser when you visit our website. This cookie records both your visit and the use of our website in anonymous form. However, personal data will not be passed on. If you subsequently visit a third-party website that also uses the Google advertising network, advertising may appear that refers to our website or our offers there.</p>
        <p>To permanently disable this feature, Google provides a browser plugin for most common browsers at</p>

        <p><strong>Cross-device marketing</strong> allows Google to track your usage patterns across multiple devices, so you may see interest-based, personalized advertising even when you switch devices. However, this requires that you have agreed to link your browsing history to your existing Google account.</p>

        <h4>Microsoft Bing Ads</h4>
        <p>Our website uses Bing Ads for remarketing and follow-up. This is a service of Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 - 6399, USA, hereinafter referred to as "Microsoft", based on so-called Universal Event Tracking (UEN).</p>
        <p>The legal basis for collecting and processing this information is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
        <p>If you click on an advertisement placed by us on the Bing search engine, Microsoft stores a cookie on your terminal device to track your activity via your browser. This cookie expires after 180 days and is not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, both Microsoft and we may recognize that you have clicked on an advertisement placed by us at Bing and have been forwarded to our website from there.</p>
        <p>Microsoft uses the information collected by the tracking cookie to compile visit statistics for us. This provides us with information on the number of hits triggered by the advertising placed on Bing and which pages on our site were subsequently accessed. However, we do not receive any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
        <p>In addition, Microsoft may be able to track your user behavior across multiple devices using cross-device tracking. This enables Microsoft to display personalized advertising across all devices.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Further details can be found in the section about cookies above.</p>

        <p>In addition, the Rocket Science Group offers further information about its data protection practices at</p>
        <p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</a></p>

        <h4>Klarna „CHECK-OUT“</h4>
        <p>To process orders through our online shop, we use the payment service of Klarna Bank AB, Sveavägen 46, 111 34 Stockholm, Sweden, hereinafter referred to as "Klarna", on our website.</p>
        <p>For this purpose, we have integrated Klarna's check-out into the final order page of our online shop.</p>
        <p>The legal basis is the fulfilment of the contract according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b.)&nbsp; EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In addition, we have a legitimate interest in offering effective and secure payment options, so that another legal basis ensues from Art. 6 para. 1 lit f.) GDPR.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By integrating Klarna, your internet browser loads the check-out page from a Klarna server. This means that the operating system you are using, type and version of your Internet browser, website from which the check-out has been requested, date and time of the call and the IP address are sent to Klarna - even without your interaction with the check-out page.</p>
        <p>As soon as you complete the order in our online shop, the data you have entered in the input fields of the check-out page will be processed by Klarna at your own responsibility in order to process the payment.</p>
        <p>With the offered payment methods "PayPal" and "Advance Payment", processing without your further consent is limited to the transfer of the payment data to us or PayPal.</p>
        <p>With the offered payment methods of "Purchase on Account", "Hire Purchase", "Credit Card", "Direct Debit" or "Immediate Payment", the following personal data is processed by Klarna for the purpose of payment processing and for identity and credit checking:</p>
        <p>- Contact information such as names, addresses, date of birth, gender, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, IP address, etc.</p>
        <p>- Information on the processing of the order, such as product type, product number, price, etc.</p>
        <p>- Payment information, such as debit and credit card data (card number, expiry date and CCV code), invoice data, account number, etc.</p>
        <p>If you choose the payment method "Purchase on Account" or "Hire Purchase", Klarna collects and uses personal data and information about your previous payment behaviour to decide whether you will be granted the desired payment method. In addition, probability values for your future payment behaviour (so-called scoring) are used. Scoring is calculated on the basis of scientifically recognized mathematical and statistical methods.</p>
